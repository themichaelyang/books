    <p>
      There was no pos­si­bil­ity of tak­ing a walk that day. We had been
      wan­der­ing, in­deed, in the leaf­less shrub­bery an hour in the morn­ing; but
      since din­ner (Mrs. Reed, when there was no com­pany, dined early) the cold
      win­ter wind had brought with it clouds so som­bre, and a rain so
      pen­e­trat­ing, that fur­ther out-door ex­er­cise was now out of the ques­tion.
    </p>

    <p>
      I was glad of it: I never liked long walks, es­pe­cially on chilly
      af­ter­noons: dread­ful to me was the com­ing home in the raw twi­light, with
      nipped ﬁn­gers and toes, and a heart sad­dened by the chid­ings of Bessie,
      the nurse, and hum­bled by the con­scious­ness of my phys­i­cal in­fe­ri­or­ity to
      Eliza, John, and Georgiana Reed.
    </p>

    <p>
      The said Eliza, John, and Georgiana were now clus­tered round their mama
      in the draw­ing-room: she lay re­clined on a sofa by the ﬁre­side, and with
      her dar­lings about her (for the time nei­ther quar­relling nor cry­ing)
      looked per­fectly happy. Me, she had dis­pensed from join­ing the group;
      say­ing,<span class="push-double"></span> <span class="pull-double">“</span>She re­gret­ted to be un­der the ne­ces­sity of keep­ing me at a
      dis­tance; but that un­til she heard from Bessie, and could dis­cover by her
      own ob­ser­va­tion, that I was en­deav­our­ing in good earnest to ac­quire a
      more so­cia­ble and child­like dis­po­si­tion, a more at­trac­tive and sprightly
      man­ner—some­thing lighter, franker, more nat­ural, as it were—she re­ally
      must ex­clude me from priv­i­leges in­tended only for con­tented, happy,
      lit­tle chil­dren.”
    </p>

    <p>
      <span class="pull-double">“</span>What does Bessie say I have done?” I asked.
    </p>

    <p>
      <span class="pull-double">“</span>Jane, I don’t like cav­illers or ques­tion­ers; be­sides, there is some­thing
      truly for­bid­ding in a child tak­ing up her el­ders in that man­ner. Be
      seated some­where; and un­til you can speak pleas­antly, re­main silent.”
    </p>

    <p>
      A break­fast-room ad­joined the draw­ing-room, I slipped in there. It
      con­tained a book­case: I soon pos­sessed my­self of a vol­ume, tak­ing care
      that it should be one stored with pic­tures. I mounted into the win­dow-
      seat: gath­er­ing up my feet, I sat cross-legged, like a Turk; and, hav­ing
      drawn the red moreen cur­tain nearly close, I was shrined in dou­ble
      re­tire­ment.
    </p>

    <p>
      Folds of scar­let drap­ery shut in my view to the right hand; to the left
      were the clear panes of glass, pro­tect­ing, but not sep­a­rat­ing me from the
      drear November day. At in­ter­vals, while turn­ing over the leaves of my
      book, I stud­ied the as­pect of that win­ter af­ter­noon. Afar, it of­fered a
      pale blank of mist and cloud; near a scene of wet lawn and storm-beat
      shrub, with cease­less rain sweep­ing away wildly be­fore a long and
      lam­en­ta­ble blast.
    </p>

    <p>
      I re­turned to my book—Be­wick’s History of British Birds: the let­ter­press
      thereof I cared lit­tle for, gen­er­ally speak­ing; and yet there were
      cer­tain in­tro­duc­tory pages that, child as I was, I could not pass quite
      as a blank. They were those which treat of the haunts of sea-fowl; of
      <span class="pull-double">“</span>the soli­tary rocks and promon­to­ries” by them only in­hab­ited; of the
      coast of Norway, stud­ded with isles from its south­ern ex­trem­ity, the
      Lindeness, or Naze, to the North Cape—
    </p>

    <p>
      <span class="pull-double">“</span>Where the Northern Ocean, in vast whirls,
      Boils round the naked, melan­choly isles
      Of far­thest Thule; and the Atlantic surge
      Pours in among the stormy Hebrides.”
    </p>

    <p>
      Nor could I pass un­no­ticed the sug­ges­tion of the bleak shores of Lapland,
      Siberia, Spitzbergen, Nova Zembla, Iceland, Greenland, with<span class="push-double"></span> <span class="pull-double">“</span>the vast
      sweep of the Arctic Zone, and those for­lorn re­gions of dreary space,—that
      reser­voir of frost and snow, where ﬁrm ﬁelds of ice, the ac­cu­mu­la­tion
      of cen­turies of win­ters, glazed in Alpine heights above heights, sur­round
      the pole, and con­cen­tre the mul­ti­plied rigours of ex­treme cold.” Of
      these death-white realms I formed an idea of my own: shad­owy, like all
      the half-com­pre­hended no­tions that ﬂoat dim through chil­dren’s brains,
      but strangely im­pres­sive. The words in these in­tro­duc­tory pages
      con­nected them­selves with the suc­ceed­ing vi­gnettes, and gave sig­nif­i­cance
      to the rock stand­ing up alone in a sea of bil­low and spray; to the bro­ken
      boat stranded on a des­o­late coast; to the cold and ghastly moon glanc­ing
      through bars of cloud at a wreck just sink­ing.
    </p>

    <p>
      I can­not tell what sen­ti­ment haunted the quite soli­tary church­yard, with
      its in­scribed head­stone; its gate, its two trees, its low hori­zon,
      gir­dled by a bro­ken wall, and its newly-risen cres­cent, at­test­ing the
      hour of even­tide.
    </p>

    <p>
      The two ships be­calmed on a tor­pid sea, I be­lieved to be ma­rine phan­toms.
    </p>

    <p>
      The ﬁend pin­ning down the thief’s pack be­hind him, I passed over
      quickly: it was an ob­ject of ter­ror.
    </p>

    <p>
      So was the black horned thing seated aloof on a rock, sur­vey­ing a dis­tant
      crowd sur­round­ing a gal­lows.
    </p>

    <p>
      Each pic­ture told a story; mys­te­ri­ous of­ten to my un­de­vel­oped
      un­der­stand­ing and im­per­fect feel­ings, yet ever pro­foundly in­ter­est­ing: as
      in­ter­est­ing as the tales Bessie some­times nar­rated on win­ter evenings,
      when she chanced to be in good hu­mour; and when, hav­ing brought her
      iron­ing-table to the nurs­ery hearth, she al­lowed us to sit about it, and
      while she got up Mrs. Reed’s lace frills, and crimped her night­cap
      bor­ders, fed our ea­ger at­ten­tion with pas­sages of love and ad­ven­ture
      taken from old fairy tales and other bal­lads; or (as at a later pe­riod I
      dis­cov­ered) from the pages of Pamela, and Henry, Earl of Moreland.
    </p>

    <p>
      With Bewick on my knee, I was then happy: happy at least in my way. I
      feared noth­ing but in­ter­rup­tion, and that came too soon. The break­fast-
      room door opened.
    </p>

    <p>
      <span class="pull-double">“</span>Boh! Madam Mope!” cried the voice of John Reed; then he paused: he
      found the room ap­par­ently empty.
    </p>

    <p>
      <span class="pull-double">“</span>Where the dick­ens is she!” he con­tin­ued.<span class="push-double"></span> <span class="pull-double">“</span>Lizzy! Georgy! (calling to
      his sis­ters) Joan is not here: tell mama she is run out into the rain—bad
      an­i­mal!”
    </p>

    <p>
      <span class="pull-double">“</span>It is well I drew the cur­tain,” thought I; and I wished fer­vently he
      might not dis­cover my hid­ing-place: nor would John Reed have found it out
      him­self; he was not quick ei­ther of vi­sion or con­cep­tion; but Eliza just
      put her head in at the door, and said at once—
    </p>

    <p>
      <span class="pull-double">“</span>She is in the win­dow-seat, to be sure, Jack.”
    </p>

    <p>
      And I came out im­me­di­ately, for I trem­bled at the idea of be­ing dragged
      forth by the said Jack.
    </p>

    <p>
      <span class="pull-double">“</span>What do you want?” I asked, with awk­ward dif­ﬁ­dence.
    </p>

    <p>
      <span class="pull-double">“</span>Say,<span class="push-single"></span> <span class="pull-single">‘</span>What do you want, Master Reed?’” was the an­swer.<span class="push-double"></span> <span class="pull-double">“</span>I want you to
      come here;” and seat­ing him­self in an arm-chair, he in­ti­mated by a
      ges­ture that I was to ap­proach and stand be­fore him.
    </p>

    <p>
      John Reed was a school­boy of four­teen years old; four years older than I,
      for I was but ten: large and stout for his age, with a dingy and
      un­whole­some skin; thick lin­ea­ments in a spa­cious vis­age, heavy limbs and
      large ex­trem­i­ties. He gorged him­self ha­bit­u­ally at table, which made him
      bil­ious, and gave him a dim and bleared eye and ﬂabby cheeks. He ought
      now to have been at school; but his mama had taken him home for a month
      or two,<span class="push-double"></span> <span class="pull-double">“</span>on ac­count of his del­i­cate health.” Mr. Miles, the mas­ter,
      af­ﬁrmed that he would do very well if he had fewer cakes and sweet­meats
      sent him from home; but the moth­er’s heart turned from an opin­ion so
      harsh, and in­clined rather to the more re­ﬁned idea that John’s
      sal­low­ness was ow­ing to over-ap­pli­ca­tion and, per­haps, to pin­ing af­ter
      home.
    </p>

    <p>
      John had not much af­fec­tion for his mother and sis­ters, and an an­tipa­thy
      to me. He bul­lied and pun­ished me; not two or three times in the week,
      nor once or twice in the day, but con­tin­u­ally: every nerve I had feared
      him, and every morsel of ﬂesh in my bones shrank when he came near.
      There were mo­ments when I was be­wil­dered by the ter­ror he in­spired,
      be­cause I had no ap­peal what­ever against ei­ther his men­aces or his
      in­ﬂic­tions; the ser­vants did not like to of­fend their young mas­ter by
      tak­ing my part against him, and Mrs. Reed was blind and deaf on the
      sub­ject: she never saw him strike or heard him abuse me, though he did
      both now and then in her very pres­ence, more fre­quently, how­ever, be­hind
      her back.
    </p>

    <p>
      Habitually obe­di­ent to John, I came up to his chair: he spent some three
      min­utes in thrust­ing out his tongue at me as far as he could with­out
      dam­ag­ing the roots: I knew he would soon strike, and while dread­ing the
      blow, I mused on the dis­gust­ing and ugly ap­pear­ance of him who would
      presently deal it. I won­der if he read that no­tion in my face; for, all
      at once, with­out speak­ing, he struck sud­denly and strongly. I tot­tered,
      and on re­gain­ing my equi­lib­rium re­tired back a step or two from his
      chair.
    </p>

    <p>
      <span class="pull-double">“</span>That is for your im­pu­dence in an­swer­ing mama awhile since,” said he,
      <span class="pull-double">“</span>and for your sneak­ing way of get­ting be­hind cur­tains, and for the look
      you had in your eyes two min­utes since, you rat!”
    </p>

    <p>
      Accustomed to John Reed’s abuse, I never had an idea of re­ply­ing to it;
      my care was how to en­dure the blow which would cer­tainly fol­low the
      in­sult.
    </p>

    <p>
      <span class="pull-double">“</span>What were you do­ing be­hind the cur­tain?” he asked.
    </p>

    <p>
      <span class="pull-double">“</span>I was read­ing.”
    </p>

    <p>
      <span class="pull-double">“</span>Show the book.”
    </p>

    <p>
      I re­turned to the win­dow and fetched it thence.
    </p>

    <p>
      <span class="pull-double">“</span>You have no busi­ness to take our books; you are a de­pen­dent, mama says;
      you have no money; your fa­ther left you none; you ought to beg, and not
      to live here with gen­tle­men’s chil­dren like us, and eat the same meals we
      do, and wear clothes at our ma­ma’s ex­pense. Now, I’ll teach you to
      rum­mage my book­shelves: for they <em>are</em> mine; all the house be­longs to me,
      or will do in a few years. Go and stand by the door, out of the way of
      the mir­ror and the win­dows.”
    </p>

    <p>
      I did so, not at ﬁrst aware what was his in­ten­tion; but when I saw him
      lift and poise the book and stand in act to hurl it, I in­stinc­tively
      started aside with a cry of alarm: not soon enough, how­ever; the vol­ume
      was ﬂung, it hit me, and I fell, strik­ing my head against the door and
      cut­ting it. The cut bled, the pain was sharp: my ter­ror had passed its
      cli­max; other feel­ings suc­ceeded.
    </p>

    <p>
      <span class="pull-double">“</span>Wicked and cruel boy!” I said.<span class="push-double"></span> <span class="pull-double">“</span>You are like a mur­derer—you are like a
      slave-dri­ver—you are like the Roman em­per­ors!”
    </p>

    <p>
      I had read Goldsmith’s History of Rome, and had formed my opin­ion of
      Nero, Caligula, etc. Also I had drawn par­al­lels in si­lence, which I never
      thought thus to have de­clared aloud.
    </p>

    <p>
      <span class="pull-double">“</span>What! what!” he cried.<span class="push-double"></span> <span class="pull-double">“</span>Did she say that to me? Did you hear her,
      Eliza and Georgiana? Won’t I tell mama? but ﬁrst—”
    </p>

    <p>
      He ran head­long at me: I felt him grasp my hair and my shoul­der: he had
      closed with a des­per­ate thing. I re­ally saw in him a tyrant, a mur­derer.
      I felt a drop or two of blood from my head trickle down my neck, and was
      sen­si­ble of some­what pun­gent suf­fer­ing: these sen­sa­tions for the time
      pre­dom­i­nated over fear, and I re­ceived him in fran­tic sort. I don’t very
      well know what I did with my hands, but he called me<span class="push-double"></span> <span class="pull-double">“</span>Rat! Rat!” and
      bel­lowed out aloud. Aid was near him: Eliza and Georgiana had run for
      Mrs. Reed, who was gone up­stairs: she now came upon the scene, fol­lowed
      by Bessie and her maid Abbot. We were parted: I heard the words—
    </p>

    <p>
      <span class="pull-double">“</span>Dear! dear! What a fury to ﬂy at Master John!”
    </p>

    <p>
      <span class="pull-double">“</span>Did ever any­body see such a pic­ture of pas­sion!”
    </p>

    <p>
      Then Mrs. Reed sub­joined—
    </p>

    <p>
      <span class="pull-double">“</span>Take her away to the red-room, and lock her in there.” Four hands were
      im­me­di­ately laid upon me, and I was borne up­stairs.
